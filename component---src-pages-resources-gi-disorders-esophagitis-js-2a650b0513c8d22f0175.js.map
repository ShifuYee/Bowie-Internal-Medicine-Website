Furthermore, \r\n\t\t\t\tif the lower esophagus narrows due to scarring, food may stick in \r\n\t\t\t\tthis area. This symptom is called dysphagia and is uncomfortable. \r\n\t\t\t\tEsophagitis also may cause bleeding. Black stools, anemia \r\n\t\t\t\t(low red blood cell count), and vomiting of blood are signs of bleeding.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2 className=\"sub-topic\">Diagnosis</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        An upper GI series of x-rays is usually done to outline the esophagus. \r\n        An endoscopy also is performed during which a flexible, fiber optic \r\n        endoscope is passed into the esophagus while the patient is lightly \r\n        sedated. The tissues can be visualized and biopsied during this \r\n        procedure. This examination is important since cancer of the esophagus\r\n        can mimic esophagitis.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2 className=\"sub-topic\">Treatment</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        General measures the patient can take to treat esophagitis are:\r\n      </p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Eat smaller and more frequent meals.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Avoid eating for 2 hours before going to bed.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Eliminate excessive bending, lifting, abdominal exercises, girdles,\r\n          and tight belts, all of which increase abdominal pressure and provoke reflux.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          If overweight, lose weight. Being overweight causes reflux.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Eliminate or significantly reduce consumption of nicotine\r\n          (cigarettes), fatty foods, alcohol, coffee, chocolate, and peppermint.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Elevate the head of the bed 8\" to 10\" by placing pillows or a wedge under\r\n          the upper part of the mattress. In this way, gravity helps keep stomach \r\n          juices out of the esophagus during sleep.\r\n        </li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n      <h2 className=\"sub-topic\">Other Treatments Include:</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <b>Antacids</b> - These can and should be used often. Generally, antacids should be\r\n        taken 30 to 60 minutes after eating and at bedtime. Liquids are preferred\r\n        to tables, with the strongest being Maalox II, Mylanta II, Gelusil II, \r\n        and Extra Strength Riopan.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2 className=\"sub-topic\">What is a Stricture ?</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The lower esophagus can open to the size of a quarter or wider. \r\n        When recurrent inflammation occurs in the esophagus, scarring dvelops, \r\n        underlying tissues become fibrous, and the opening narrows. \r\n        In advanced cases, this narrowing, or stricture, can be severe.\r\n        The opening may be reduced to the size of a pencil or even smaller.\r\n        Food and fluid are delayed and only move slowly across the opening\r\n        into the stomach. A large piece of food, such as meat may completely\r\n        block the esophagus. As mentioned, cancer can narrow the esophagus\r\n        in the same way. Therefore, it is critical that the physician rule\r\n        out this diagnosis.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2 className=\"sub-topic\">Treatment</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The physician can use a variety of methods to gently but forcefully\r\n        open, or dilate, a stricture. Dilation is often performed in \r\n        conjunction with an upper endoscopy exam. One of the following \r\n        dilatation methods may be used:\r\n      </p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Bougie - A series of increasingly larger, soft rubber or \r\n          plastic dilators are moved across the stricture, gently opening it. \r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Guided wire - A thin wire, placed across the stricture, is used to \r\n          guide increasingly wider dilators over it.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Balloons - Different types of sausage-shaped balloons can be \r\n          placed across the stricture. The balloon is sharply inflated \r\n          to open the narrowed area.\r\n        </li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n      <h2 className=\"sub-topic\">Are There any Alternatives to Dilation ?</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The only alternative to dilatation for opening a stricture is surgery. \r\n        It is recommended only in the most extreme cases and when dilatation fails.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2 className=\"sub-topic\">Complications</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        With dilation, minimal bleeding almost always occurs, although it is\r\n        rarely excessive or serious. A rare but serious, complication is a\r\n        perforation, or tearing, of the esophagus. This causes increasing\r\n        pain after the procedure and may require surgery to correct it.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2 className=\"sub-topic\">Summary</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Esophagitis usually can be treated easily with a conservative program\r\n        of medical care. When scarring becomes severe, a stricture can occur.\r\n        This condition can be treated by simple dilatation. While complications \r\n        can occur, they are uncommon. Most patients obtain complete relief of \r\n        their swallowing problems. By working with the physician, \r\n        the correct program can be developed for each patient.\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n)\r\n\r\nexport default Esophagitis\r\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/pages/resources/gi-disorders/esophagitis.js"],"sourceRoot":""}
