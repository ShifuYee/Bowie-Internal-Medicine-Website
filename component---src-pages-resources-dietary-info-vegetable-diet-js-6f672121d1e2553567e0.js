Soybeans and soy bean milk and dark green leafy vegetables are good sources of calcium and iron, but spinach, chard, and beet greens should be eaten in smaller amounts because they contain oxalic acid. Oxalic acid may interfere with the absorption of calcium. Whole grains and cereals, legumes, dates, prunes and raisins are rich in iron. If they are eaten with foods that have ascorbic acid or vitamin C in them, the iron will be absorbed well by the body.
