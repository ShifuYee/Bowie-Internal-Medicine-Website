This symptom may \r\n        result form other disorders, such as peptic ulcers or even heart \r\n        disease. Some patients with coronary heart disease fool themselves\r\n        into believing their discomfort is due to a hiatus hernia. \r\n        If upper-abdominal pain or indigestion occurs, people should \r\n        not mislead themselves into thinking the cause is a hiatal hernia. \r\n        Instead, the patient should seek medical advice.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2 className=\"sub-topic\">Diagnosis</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Diagnosis of a hiatus hernia is typically made through an upper GI barium\r\n\t\t\t\tx-ray. A complementary test is gastroscopy, or upper-intestinal endoscopy,\r\n\t\t\t\tin which the physician visually examines the esophagus and stomach using a\r\n\t\t\t\tflexible scope while the patient is lightly sedated.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2 className=\"sub-topic\">What Are the Complications ?</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The complication of hiatal hernia are:\r\n      </p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Chronic heartburn and inflammation of the lower esophagus, \r\n          called reflux esophagitis.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Anemia due to chronic bleeding from the lower esophagus. \r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Scarring and narrowing of the lower esophagus causing difficulty in swallowing. \r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          While sleeping, stomach secretions can seep up the esophagus and \r\n          into the lungs causing chronic cough, wheezing, and even pneumonia. \r\n        </li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n      <p>\r\n        In addition, the complicated hernia can cause serious problems \r\n        such as difficulty in breathing or sever chest pain, especially in the elderly.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2 className=\"sub-topic\">Treatment</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Treatment is called for only when the hernia results in symptoms, \r\n        such as persistent heartburn or difficulty in swallowing.\r\n        Acid inflammation and ulceration of the lower esophagus also require treatment.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h3>General guidelines for treating heartburn and esophagitis \r\n      (inflammation of the esophagus) are:</h3>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Avoid (or use only in moderation) foods and substances that increase reflux\r\n          of acid into the esophagus, such as: nicotine, fatty foods, alcohol, \r\n          caffeine chocolate, peppermint, spearmint \r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Eat smaller, more frequent meals and do not eat within 2-3 hours of bedtime. \r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Avoid bending, stooping, abdominal exercises, tight belts,\r\n          and girdles all of which increase abdominal pressure and cause reflux. \r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          If overweight, lose weight. Obesity also increases abdominal pressure. \r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Prescription medications. Certain drugs, such as intestinal antispasmodics,\r\n          calcium channel blockers, and some antidepressants weaken the muscle \r\n          strength of the lower esophagus. \r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Elevate the head of the bed 8 to 10 inches by putting pillows\r\n          or a wedge under the upper part of the mattress. Gravity then\r\n          helps keep stomach acid out of the esophagus while sleeping.\r\n        </li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n      <h2 className=\"sub-topic\">Other Treatment</h2>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <u>Drugs</u> - Some medicines effectively reduce the secretion of stomach acid, \r\n          while other increase the muscle strength of the lower \r\n          esophagus, thereby reducing acid reflux.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <u>Surgery</u> - The complicated hiatus hernia requires surgery occasionally\r\n          on an emergency basis. Surgery otherwise is reserved for those \r\n          patients with complications that cannot be handled with \r\n          mediations. The mere presence of a hiatus hernia is not \r\n          a reason for surgery.\r\n        </li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n      <h2 className=\"sub-topic\">Summary</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        A hiatal hernia is an extremely common condition which usually does \r\n        not cause symptoms or problems. However, when it does, the physician \r\n        can frequently treat the problem effectively with a well-planned program.\r\n        Surgery is infrequently required to treat a hiatus hernia.\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n)\r\n\r\nexport default HiatalHernia\r\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/pages/resources/gi-disorders/hiatalHernia.js"],"sourceRoot":""}
