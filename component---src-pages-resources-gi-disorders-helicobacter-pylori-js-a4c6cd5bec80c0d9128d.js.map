Interestingly, one of \r\n\t\t\t\tthese antibiotics is a bismuth compound that is available \r\n\t\t\t\tover-the-counter as Pepto-Bismol. It is also available as a \r\n\t\t\t\tgeneric drug called bismuth subalicylate. The bismuth part of \r\n\t\t\t\tthe medicine actually kills the bacteria. However, do not go to\r\n\t\t\t\tthe drugstore and purchase a bottle of Pepto-Bismol, expecting \r\n\t\t\t\tthis alone to cure the infection. H. pylori is buried deep in \r\n\t\t\t\tthe stomach mucous, so it is difficult to get rid of this \r\n\t\t\t\tinfection. Several antibiotic drugs are always used together \r\n\t\t\t\tto prevent the bacteria from developing resistance to any one \r\n\t\t\t\tof them. Current medical studies are being done to develop easier\r\n\t\t\t\ttreatment programs for this difficult infection.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2 className=\"sub-topic\">Summary</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        H. pylori is a very common infection of the stomach. It may be \r\n        the most common infection in the world. It is now clear that \r\n        the infection is directly related to the development of stomach\r\n        and duodenal ulcers, and it is likely that it may be related to\r\n        cancers involving the stomach. There are several diagnostic tests\r\n        available, and effective treatment can prevent the recurrence of \r\n        ulcers and perhaps the development of cancer.\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n)\r\n\r\nexport default HelicobacterPylori\r\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/pages/resources/gi-disorders/helicobacterPylori.js"],"sourceRoot":""}
