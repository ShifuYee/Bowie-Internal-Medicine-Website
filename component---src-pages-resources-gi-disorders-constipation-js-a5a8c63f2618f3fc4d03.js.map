After serious problems are excluded,\r\n        chronic constipation usually responds to simple measures, such as adding\r\n        fiber, bran or a bulking agent to the diet. \r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        General guidelines for treating constipation include: eating regularly,\r\n        drinking plenty of liquids each day, regular walking and performing\r\n        aerobic exercise. In particular, patients should respond to the\r\n        urge to defecate. Retaining stool at this point will aggravate the condition.\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <u>Diet</u> - Foods that are high in roughage, bran and fiber are essential \r\n        in correction and preventing constipation. In parts of the world\r\n        where unprocessed grain is used and where large amounts of fiber\r\n        are consumed, there is little constipation, and passing one or two \r\n        large, soft stools a day is normal. The following foods should be \r\n        eaten daily in adequate amounts:\r\n      </p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n          Whole grain breads (whole wheat)\r\n        </li>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n          Bran cereals\r\n        </li>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tVegetables: Root (potatoes, carrots, turnips), \r\n\t\t\t\t\tleafy greens (lettuce, celery, spinach), or cooked high residue (cabbage) \r\n\t\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFruit: Cooked or stewed (prunes, applesauce) \r\n\t\t\t\t\tor fresh fruit (skin and pulp)\r\n\t\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t</ul>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <u>Bulking Agents</u> - Fiber is the undigested part of plant food \r\n        that passes into the colon. Certain types of fiber can absorb and hold \r\n        large amounts of water. . This, in turn, results in a larger, \r\n        bulkier stool that is softer and easier to pass. A Adequate fiber in food or \r\n        from supplements is recommended daily. This type of water-retaining \r\n        fiber generally is easily obtained each day by one of the following:\r\n      </p>\r\n\t\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<u>Food bran</u> - This is available as wheat, oat or rice bran. \r\n\t\t\t\t\tProcessing of wheat and other grains removes this \r\n\t\t\t\t\tvaluable fibrous part of the food so these processed products should be avoided. \r\n\t\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<u>Psyllium bran</u> - The psyllium plant is remarkable because its ground \r\n\t\t\t\t\tseeds can retain so much water. This product is available as \r\n\t\t\t\t\tmetamucil, Konsyl, Effersyllium, Per Diem Fiber, or the less\r\n\t\t\t\t\texpensive generic preparation in drug and health food stores. \r\n\t\t\t\t\tAlthough labeled a laxative, it really is not a laxative.\r\n\t\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<u>Methylcellulose</u> - This is another fiber derived from wood that\r\n\t\t\t\t\talso retains water.

They occasionally help temporary \r\n\t\t\t\tconstipation problems. However, chronic use of laxatives is \r\n\t\t\t\tdiscouraged because the bowel becomes dependent upon them.    \r\n\t\t\t\tBowel regularity should occur without laxatives. An occasional \r\n\t\t\t\tenema is preferable over the chronic use of laxatives.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2 className=\"sub-topic\">Surgery</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        With certain medical conditions, such as severe diverticulosis, \r\n\t\t\t\tand with extreme constipation in some younger patients,\r\n\t\t\t\tsurgery may provide relief.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2 className=\"sub-topic\">Bowel Retraining Program</h2>\r\n      <ol>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDo not use laxatives.\r\n\t\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tEat a diet high in roughage, such as bran cereals and leafy vegetables.\r\n\t\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t Drink six ounces of prune or apricot juice each morning.\r\n\t\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tEat two large servings of stewed fruit each day.\r\n\t\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTake one heaping tablespoon of a psyllium-based bulking \r\n\t\t\t\t\tagent twice a day.
