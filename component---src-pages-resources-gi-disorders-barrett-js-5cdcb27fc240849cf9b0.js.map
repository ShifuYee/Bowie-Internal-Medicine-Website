Newer medications, such as\r\n        Prilosec, Nexium, Protonix, and Prevacid, can almost eliminate stomach acid\r\n        entirely and are almost always needed to treat severe GERD. \r\n        Reglan (generic: metoclopramide) is the drug that can strengthen the LES.\r\n\t\t\t<br/>\r\n      <br/>\r\n        Certain patients with GERD may need surgery to strengthen the LES. \r\n        This type of surgery is called fundoplication. It is often done by laparoscopy.\r\n        Laparoscopy is minimally invasive surgery, performed with a tiny incision\r\n        at the naval and a few needlepoints in the upper abdomen. The patient usually\r\n        returns home in 1-2 days.\r\n\t\t\t<br/>\r\n      <br/>\r\n        A diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus requires regular monitoring by a physician.\r\n        While it is thought that controlling GERD reduces the risk of developing cancer,\r\n        this has not yet been definitely proven. Therefore, the physician must \r\n        perform regular endoscopy exams and biopsies to look for dysplasia. \r\n        Just how often these exams are repeated depends on how far the disease\r\n        has advanced. If cancer is found, surgery to remove the lower esophagus\r\n        (esophagectomy) is usually necessary. Physicians often recommend \r\n        this procedure when a high grade of dysplasia is present, so as to prevent\r\n        the cancer that is likely to occur.\r\n\t\t\t<br/>\r\n      <br/>\r\n        There are also new experimental treatments being studied. They include\r\n        laser destruction of the abnormal Barrett's tissue, and a process called\r\n        photodynamic therapy. In this treatment, a special drug is injected \r\n        into the bloodstream and is absorbed only by the dysplastic cells.\r\n        These cells are then destroyed when exposed to a special frequency \r\n        of red light. It is too soon to know how effective these treatments\r\n        will be, but the early data is promising.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2 className=\"sub-topic\">Summary</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Barrett's esophagus is a condition that may develop as a result of chronic GERD. \r\n        Barrett's tissue growing in the esophagus is the body's defense against continued \r\n        stomach acid irritation. Yet, this tissue does not belong in the esophagus, and \r\n        for some patients, it increases the risk, of developing adenocarcinoma (cancer) \r\n        of the esophagus. While there is no treatment to reverse this condition, the \r\n        likelihood of developing cancer and complications can be reduced with a combination \r\n        of diet, lifestyle changes, medication, and/or surgery. A regular program of \r\n        endoscopic examination and biopsy is essential to monitor the Barrett's tissue. \r\n        There are also promising new techniques under investigation. By working closely \r\n        with a physician, patients with Barrett's esophagus can expect good control of \r\n        both GERD and Barrett's, and an excellent long-term outcome.\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n)\r\n\r\nexport default Barrett\r\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/pages/resources/gi-disorders/barrett.js"],"sourceRoot":""}
