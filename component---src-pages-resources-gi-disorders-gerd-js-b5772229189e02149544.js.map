Some that reduce stomach acid include Tagamet, Zantac,\r\n        Pepcid and Axid. Certain potent newer drugs are most frequently used when GERD\r\n        is severe. Other medications, such as Propulsid and Reglan tighten the LES.\r\n        These may be especially useful at night when reflux often occurs. A number\r\n        of patients with GERD may need surgery to strengthen the LES. This procedure\r\n        is called fundoplication. Previously this surgery required a major operation,\r\n        often through the chest. \r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\t\r\n        It is a difficult operation for the patient, with a long recovery time.\r\n        It is now usually done by laparoscopy. This is a new type of minimally\r\n        invasive surgery, performed with a tiny incision at the naval and a \r\n        few needlepoints in the upper abdomen. The patient usually returns \r\n        home 1-2 days after surgery, with few problems. Surgery, however, \r\n        should not be considered until all other measures have been tried. \r\n        Surgery is often seriously considered for an otherwise healthy \r\n        patient when the disease is severe, or the patient does not want \r\n        to face the expense or regimen of long-term treatment with medications.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2 className=\"sub-topic\">Summary</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        GERD is a common problem that requires medical attention when symptoms and\r\n\t\t\t\ttissue damage become troublesome. Fortunately, there is a great deal that \r\n\t\t\t\tcan now be done about GERD. Lifestyle changes can help, and there are \r\n\t\t\t\tmany medications and even surgery to treat and correct GERD. Working \r\n\t\t\t\ttogether with the physician, a good medical program can almost always\r\n\t\t\t\tbe developed to successfully treat the patient with GERD.\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n)\r\n\r\nexport default Gerd\r\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/pages/resources/gi-disorders/gerd.js"],"sourceRoot":""}
