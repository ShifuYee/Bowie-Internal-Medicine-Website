Acute episodes can be triggered by emotional tension and anxiety, poor dietary habits, and certain medications. Increased amounts of fiber in the diet can help relieve symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome by producing soft, bulky stools and by helping to normalize the time the stool takes to pass through the colon. The increased bulk also reduces the pressure necessary to push food waste through the colon. This results in less discomfort.

Most colon cancer begins as a colon polyp, a benign mushroom-shaped growth that in time grows and, in some people, becomes a cancer. Colon cancer is preventable if polyps are removed at an early stage. It is now known that the tendency to develop colon cancer may be inherited, but there may be other factors involved as well. One theory is that carcinogens in the diet and environment can stay in contact with the colon wall a longer time and in higher concentrations when the diet is low in fiber. A large, bulky stool acts to dilute and diffuse these carcinogens and to move them through the bowel more quickly.
