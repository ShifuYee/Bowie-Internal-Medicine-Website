Medical studies are under way to determine the relationship between the two and how an infection in the stomach can be related to a duodenal ulcer. Acid is still important; patients without acid in the stomach never get duodenal ulcers. However, physicians now accept the fact that the infection is directly related to the development of duodenal ulcers.
