    <h1 className="main-subject">Capsule Endoscopy (Camera Pill)</h1>
    <p>
      For the first time ever, images of the entire small intestine 
      are obtainable to assist the physician in the diagnosis and 
      treatment of gastrointestinal diseases.
      <br />
      <br />
      Capsule Endoscopy is a "state of the art" equipment. 
      Gastrointestinal diseases affect millions of people in the 
      United States annually. Diseases of the Small intestine are 
      difficult to diagnose due to the limitations of current 
      diagnostic tools. These limitations often lead to multiple 
      procedures without definite diagnosis. Capsule Endoscopy is 
      an innovative diagnostic tool that is non-invasive, easy to 
      perform and provides a substantially improved level of visual 
      imaging for early detection and diagnosis of gastrointestinal 
      tract diseases.

    <h2 className="sub-topic">What is Capsule Endoscopy ?</h2>
    <p>
      Capsule Endoscopy is a non-invasive, high quality, disposable, 
      diagnostic imaging device for the use in the gastrointestinal 
      tract. Capsule Endoscopy uses a disposable miniature video 
      camera contained in a capsule (Camera Pill Endoscope) that 
      is ingested by the patient. It is propelled by peristalsis 
      to naturally move through the digestive tract. The Camera 
      Pill contains a complete optical system with a video chip, 
      light source, transmitter, and energy source designed 
      specifically for direct imaging within the intestinal tract. 
      The camera takes two images per second, which is approximately 
      50,000 pictures in a 8 hour period. It transmits the data to 
      a recording device worn around the waist of the patient.
      <br />
      <br /> 
      Once the study is completed, the recording device is connected 
      to a computer whose software provides the images to the computer 
      screen. The procedure is ambulatory, allowing patients to 
      continue daily activities throughout the endoscopic examination.
    </p>
    <h2 className="sub-topic">What preparation is required ?</h2>
    <p>
      Basically, for capsule endoscopy, the patient has to fast for 
      at least ten hours prior to the procedure. The day before the 
      procedure it is essential that liquid diet be maintained starting 
      at 8:00p.m. and nothing to eat or drink after midnight.
    </p>
    <h2 className="sub-topic">What about my current medications ?</h2>
    <p>
      Most medications may be continued as usual, but some can interfere 
      with the preparation or the examination. Inform your physician 
      of your current medications several days prior to your visit. 
      Aspirin products, arthritis medicines, anticoagulants (blood 
      thinner such as Coumadin), insulin and iron products are examples. 
      It is advised not to take any medications before the procedure. 
      However, some medications can be resumed 4 hours after ingesting 
      the capsule EXCEPT anticoagulants, Aspirin, NSAIDs.
    </p>
    <h2 className="sub-topic">The day of the procedure ?</h2>
    <p>
      Please come to the facility at your scheduled time. Wear loose 
      fit clothing such as sweat pants. Once you are registered, 
      and all the proper connections have been made, you are ready 
      to swallow the pill. The capsule is the size of a vitamin pill 
      and will be swallowed with a cup of water.
    </p>
    <h2 className="sub-topic">What is Expected after Ingesting the Capsule ?</h2>
    <p>
      You may drink clear liquids (water, apple juice) 2 hours after 
      swallowing the pill. You may eat a light snack 4 hours after 
      ingesting the pill, and 8 hours after, you may resume your 
      regular diet. Avoid exercise and heavy lifting. You may walk, 
      sit, lie down, and drive a car. If your job allows avoiding 
      unsuitable environment or physical movements, then you can 
      return to work. Avoid going near MRI machines and other equipment 
      that have high frequency waves. DO NOT remove sensor array leads, 
      and avoid getting them wet. Return to the facility the next day 
      before 10:00am.
      <br />

      abdominal pain, chest pain, fever, difficulty swallowing or if you 
      have any questions.
    </p>
    <h2 className="sub-topic">Billing and Insurance</h2>
    <p>
      Capsule Endoscopy is a new procedure, some insurance companies 
      may not cover the entire bill, therefore, patient may be 
      responsible for part of the bill. Physician fees are separate 
      from the facility's fee. Because patient will be carrying part 
      of the instrument with them, there will be a $200.00 retaining 
      fee. For your convenience, we accept cash, checks, VISA, 
      MasterCard and Discover Card. Please note that the retaining fee 
      will be reimbursed once the equipment is returned to the facility. 
      If you have any questions regarding your bill, please feel free to 
      call us.
