      <p>
        The esophagus is the food tube, or gullet, that carries food and 
        liquid from the mouth to the stomach. The stomach churns the food 
        and secretes a strong acid that aids in digestion. A specialized 
        muscle, known as the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), is 
        located at the end of the esophagus.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This muscle normally contracts firmly, relaxing only to allow food and 
        liquid to pass from the esophagus into the stomach. This muscle 
        maintains a certain pressure to keep the end of the esophagus closed,
        preventing stomach acid and digested food from moving back into the esophagus. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        However, the LES muscle does not always work perfectly. It can easily be
        overcome by a number of factors, the most common being eating a large meal.
        Other agents that weaken the LES muscle and allow reflux of stomach juices are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Nicotine (cigarettes)
        </li>
        <li>
          Fried or fatty foods 
        </li>
        <li>
          Chocolate 
        </li>
        <li>
          Coffee 
        </li>
        <li>
          Citrus fruits and juices 
        </li>
        <li>
          Peppermints 
        </li>
        <li>
          Pregnancy 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">What is Esophagitis ?</h2>
      <p>
        When stomach acid and digestive enzymes repeatedly reflux into the esophagus,
        the tissues become inflamed and ulcerated. This inflammation is known as esophagitis.
        When the inflammation is severe, esophageal ulcers develop.
      </p>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">Does Hiatus Hernia Cause Esophagitis ?</h2>
      <p>
        A hiatus hernia exists when part of the stomach protrudes through the 
        diaphragm muscle into the chest. When the hernia is fixed in this 
        position, stomach acid and food do not drain out of it quickly and 
        the LES pressure is overcome. This results in tissue damage to 
        the esophagus. A fixed hiatus hernia, therefore, is an important 
        factor in causing esophagitis.
      </p>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">Are There Other Causes of Esophagitis ?</h2>
      <p>
        Certain infections, such as a fungus infection (Monilia, Candida) 
        and viruses, can occur in the esophagus and cause inflammation. 
        Irradiation and caustic substances, like lye, also can cause 
        esophagitis. Acid reflux from the stomach, however, is by far 
        the most common cause of the condition.
      </p>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">What are the Signs and Symptoms ?</h2>
      <p>
        Heartburn occurs when acid refluxes into the esophagus. It is experienced as a burning 
				sensation in the lower chest and may be felt up the esophagus. 
				At times, bitter-tasting liquid may regurgitate up into the mouth. 
				When esophagitis is severe and ulcers are present, swallowing may 
				cause pain when food reaches this part of the esophagus. Furthermore, 
				if the lower esophagus narrows due to scarring, food may stick in 
				this area. This symptom is called dysphagia and is uncomfortable. 
				Esophagitis also may cause bleeding. Black stools, anemia 
				(low red blood cell count), and vomiting of blood are signs of bleeding.
      </p>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">Diagnosis</h2>
      <p>
        An upper GI series of x-rays is usually done to outline the esophagus. 
        An endoscopy also is performed during which a flexible, fiber optic 
        endoscope is passed into the esophagus while the patient is lightly 
        sedated. The tissues can be visualized and biopsied during this 
        procedure. This examination is important since cancer of the esophagus
        can mimic esophagitis.
      </p>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">Treatment</h2>
      <p>
        General measures the patient can take to treat esophagitis are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Eat smaller and more frequent meals.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid eating for 2 hours before going to bed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Eliminate excessive bending, lifting, abdominal exercises, girdles,
          and tight belts, all of which increase abdominal pressure and provoke reflux.
        </li>
        <li>
          If overweight, lose weight. Being overweight causes reflux.
        </li>
        <li>
          Eliminate or significantly reduce consumption of nicotine
          (cigarettes), fatty foods, alcohol, coffee, chocolate, and peppermint.
        </li>
        <li>
          Elevate the head of the bed 8" to 10" by placing pillows or a wedge under
          the upper part of the mattress. In this way, gravity helps keep stomach 
          juices out of the esophagus during sleep.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">Other Treatments Include:</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Antacids</b> - These can and should be used often. Generally, antacids should be
        taken 30 to 60 minutes after eating and at bedtime. Liquids are preferred
        to tables, with the strongest being Maalox II, Mylanta II, Gelusil II, 
        and Extra Strength Riopan.
      </p>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">What is a Stricture ?</h2>
      <p>
        The lower esophagus can open to the size of a quarter or wider. 
        When recurrent inflammation occurs in the esophagus, scarring dvelops, 
        underlying tissues become fibrous, and the opening narrows. 
        In advanced cases, this narrowing, or stricture, can be severe.
        The opening may be reduced to the size of a pencil or even smaller.
        Food and fluid are delayed and only move slowly across the opening
        into the stomach. A large piece of food, such as meat may completely
        block the esophagus. As mentioned, cancer can narrow the esophagus
        in the same way. Therefore, it is critical that the physician rule
        out this diagnosis.
      </p>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">Treatment</h2>
      <p>
        The physician can use a variety of methods to gently but forcefully
        open, or dilate, a stricture. Dilation is often performed in 
        conjunction with an upper endoscopy exam. One of the following 
        dilatation methods may be used:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Bougie - A series of increasingly larger, soft rubber or 
          plastic dilators are moved across the stricture, gently opening it. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Guided wire - A thin wire, placed across the stricture, is used to 
          guide increasingly wider dilators over it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Balloons - Different types of sausage-shaped balloons can be 
          placed across the stricture. The balloon is sharply inflated 
          to open the narrowed area.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">Are There any Alternatives to Dilation ?</h2>
      <p>
        The only alternative to dilatation for opening a stricture is surgery. 
        It is recommended only in the most extreme cases and when dilatation fails.
      </p>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">Complications</h2>
      <p>
        With dilation, minimal bleeding almost always occurs, although it is
        rarely excessive or serious. A rare but serious, complication is a
        perforation, or tearing, of the esophagus. This causes increasing
        pain after the procedure and may require surgery to correct it.
      </p>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Esophagitis usually can be treated easily with a conservative program
        of medical care. When scarring becomes severe, a stricture can occur.
        This condition can be treated by simple dilatation. While complications 
        can occur, they are uncommon. Most patients obtain complete relief of 
        their swallowing problems. By working with the physician, 
        the correct program can be developed for each patient.
