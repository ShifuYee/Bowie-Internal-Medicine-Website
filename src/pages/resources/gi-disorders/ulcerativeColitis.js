      <p>
        Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, recurring disease of the 
        large bowel. The large bowel (colon) is the 5 to 6 foot segment
        of intestine that begins in the right-lower abdomen, extends
        upward and then across to the left side, and downward to the rectum.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        It dehydrates the liquid stool that enters it and stores the
        formed stool until a bowel movement occurs. When ulcerative 
        colitis affects the colon, inflammation and ulcers, or sores,
        form in the lining of the colon. The disease may involve the
        entire colon (pancolitis), or, most commonly, a particular
        area in the colon.
      </p>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">Causes</h2>
      <p>
        The cause of ulcerative colitis is unknown. Some experts believe
        there many be a defect in the immune system in which the body's 
        antibodies actually injure the colon. Others speculate that an
        unidentified microorganism or germ is responsible for the 
        disease. It is probable that a combination of factors, 
        including heredity, may be involved in the cause.
      </p>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">Who develops Ulcerative Colitis ?</h2>
      <p>
        The disorder can occur in both sexes, all races and all age groups.
        It is a disease that usually begins in young people.
      </p>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">Symptoms</h2>
      <p>
        The disorder typically begins gradually, with crampy abdominal 
        pain, diarrhea and sometimes bloody diarrhea. In severe cases,
        diarrhea is very severe and frequent. Loss of appetite and 
        weight loss also occurs. The patient may become weak and very
        sick. When the disease is localized to the rectum, the 
        symptoms are rectal urgency and passage of small amounts 
        of bloody stool. Usually these symptoms tend to come and go,
        and there may be long periods without any symptoms at all.
      </p>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">Diagnosis</h2>
      <p>
        Diagnosis of ulcerative colitis can be suspected from 
				the symptoms. Certain blood and stool tests are performed
				to rule out an infection that can mimic the disorder. 
				A visual examination of the lining of the rectum and 
				lower colon (sigmoidoscopy) or the entire colon 
				(colonoscopy) is always required. This exam typically 
				reveals a characteristic pattern. Small, painless 
				biopsies are taken which show certain features of 
				ulcerative colitis. A barium enema x-ray of the 
				colon is also needed at some point during the 
				course of the disease.
      </p>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">Complications</h2>
      <p>
        Most patients respond well to treatment and go about their 
        lives with few interruptions. However, some attacks may be 
        quite severe, requiring a period of bowel rest, hospitalization
        and intravenous treatment. In rare cases, emergency surgery
        is required. The disease can affect nutrition causing poor 
        growth during childhood and adolescence. Liver, skin, eye 
        or joint (arthritis) problems occasionally occur, even before 
        the bowel symptoms develop. Other problems can include narrowing 
        and partial blocking of the bile ducts which carry bile from 
        the liver to the intestine. Fortunately, there is much 
        that can be done about all of these complications. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In long-standing ulcerative colitis, the major concern is colon 
        cancer. The risk of developing colon cancer increases significantly 
        when the disorder begins in childhood, has been present for 8 
        to 10 years, or when there is a family history of colon cancer.
        In these situations, it is particularly important to perform 
        regular and thorough surveillance of the colon, even when there
        are no symptoms. Analysis of colon biopsies performed during 
        colonoscopy can often predict if colon cancer will occur. 
        In these cases preventive surgery is recommended.
      </p>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">Treatment</h2>
      <p>
        There are several types of medical treatments available:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <u>Cortisone, Steroids , Predinisone</u> - These powerful drugs 
          usually provide highly effective results. A high dose is 
          often used initially to bring the disorder under control. 
          Then the drug is tapered to low, maintenance doses. These 
          medications are given by pill, enema or intravenously during 
          an acute attack. In time, the physician will usually try to 
          discontinue these drugs because of potential long-term, 
          adverse side effects.
        </li>
        <li>	
          <u>Other Anti-inflammatory Drugs</u> - There are increasing numbers
          of these drugs available. They can be given by pill or enema.
          The generic and trade names of some of these drugs are 
          sufasalazine (Azulfidine), olsalazine (dipentum), and
          mesalamine (Asacol, Pentasa, and Rowasa).
        </li>
        <li>
          <u>Immune System Suppression</u> - An overactive immune system is probably 
          important in causing ulcerative colitis. Certain drugs such as 
          azathioprine (Imuran), 6-MP (Purinethol), cyclosporine 
          (neoral, Sandimmune), and methotrexate (Rheumatrex) suppress
          the immune system and at times are effective.
        </li>	
      </ul>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">Diet and Emotions</h2>
      <p>
        There are no foods known to injure the bowel. However, during an acute
				phase of the disease, bulky foods, milk, and milk products can
				increase diarrhea and cramping. Generally, the patient is advised 
				to eat a well-balanced diet, with adequate protein and calories.
				A multi-vitamin and iron supplement may be recommended by the physician.
				Stress, anxiety, and extreme emotions may aggravate symptoms of 
				the disorder, but are not believed to cause it or make it worse.
				Any chronic disease can produce a serious emotional reaction,
				which be handled through discussion with the physician.
      </p>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">Surgery</h2>
      <p>
        For patients with long-standing disease that is difficult
				or impossible to control with medicine, surgery is a 
				welcomed option. In these rare cases, the patient's 
				lifestyle and general health have been significantly 
				affected. Surgical removal of the colon cures the 
				disease and returns good health and a normal lifestyle
				to the patient. In the past, a bag or ileostomy, was 
				required for surgery. Advances in technology, may avoid
				this problem by removing the colon and creating a pouch 
				or reservoir from the small intestine. Three to six liquid
				bowel movements occur daily. Most patients are extremely
				pleased with this new surgery.
      </p>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Most people with ulcerative colitis lead active lives with
				few restrictions. Although there is no cure (except by surgery),
				the disorder can be managed with present treatments. For a 
				few patients, the course of the disease can be more difficult 
				and complicated, requiring extensive testing and therapy. 
				Surgery sometimes is required. In all cases, follow-up care 
				is essential to treat the disease and prevent or deal with 
				complications that may arise.
