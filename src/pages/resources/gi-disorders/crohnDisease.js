      <h1 className="main-subject">Crohn's Disease</h1>		
      <p>
        Crohn's disease is a chronic, recurrent inflammatory disease of the 
        intestinal tract. The intestinal tract has four major parts: 
        the esophagus, or food tube; the stomach, where food is churned and
        digested; the long, small bowel, where nutrients, calories, and 
        vitamins are absorbed; and the colon and rectum, where water is 
        absorbed and stool is stored. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The two primary sites for Crohn's disease are the ileum, which is 
        the last portion of the small bowel (ileitis, regional enteritis),
        and the colon (Crohn's colitis). The condition begins as small, 
        microscopic nests of inflammation, which persist and smolder. 
        The lining of the bowel can then become ulcerated and the bowel
        wall thickened. Eventually, the bowel may become narrowed.
      </p>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">What Causes Crohn's Disease ?</h2>
      <p>
        After many years of intense research, the cause of Crohn's disease
        is still unknown. One theory is that an unidentified, slow-growing
        microorganism causes the condition. The body's immune system, 
        which protects it against many different infections, is also 
        known to be a factor. In spite of the unknown cause, enormous
        understanding and knowledge currently exists about the 
        disease and its treatment.
      </p>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">Symptoms</h2>
      <p>
        The symptoms of Crohn's disease depend on where in the intestinal 
        tract the disorder first appears. When the ileum (ileitis) is 
        involved, recurrent pain may be experienced in the right lower
        abdomen. At times, the pain mimics acute appendicitis. 
        When the colon is the site, diarrhea (which is sometimes bloody)
        may occur, as well as fever and weight loss. When the inflammation
        is active, fatigue and lethargy appear. In children and young 
        people there may be difficulty gaining or maintaining weight.
      </p>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">Diagnosis</h2>
      <p>
        Usually there is no one conclusive diagnostic test for Crohn's
        disease. The physician uses a series of tests to assess 
        the patient's overall condition and then makes a diagnosis.
        The patient's medical history and physical exam are always 
        helpful. Certain blood and stool tests are performed to 
        arrive at a diagnosis. X-rays of the small intestine and 
        colon (obtained through an upper GI series and barium enema)
        are usually required.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In addition, a visual examination (sigmoidoscopy) of the 
        lining of the rectum and lower bowel is usually necessary.
        A more extensive exam of the entire colon (colonoscopy) is 
        often the best way of diagnosing the problem when the 
        disease is in the colon.
      </p>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">Course and Complications</h2>
      <p>
        The disorder often remains quiet and easily controlled
				for long periods of time. Most people with Crohn's disease
				continue to pursue their goals in life, go to school, 
				marry, have a family, and work with few limitations 
				or inconveniences. Some problems, outside the bowel,
				can occur. Arthritis, eye and skin problems, 
				and--in rare instances--chronic liver conditions 
				may develop. The disease can occur around the anal 
				canal. Open sores called fissures can develop, 
				which are often painful. A fistula can also form.
				This is a tiny channel that burrows from the rectum 
				to the skin around the anus. In addition, when 
				inflammation persists in the ileum or colon, 
				narrowing and partial obstruction may occur. 
				Often surgery is required to treat these 
				problems. When Crohn's disease has been present
				for many years there is an increased risk of cancer.
      </p>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">Treatment</h2>
      <p>
        Effective medical and surgical treatment is available for Crohn's
        disease. It is particularly important to maintain good 
        nutrition and health with a balanced diet, adequate exercise,
        and a positive, upbeat attitude.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Four types of medications are usually used in treating this disease:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <u>Cortisone or Steroids</u> - These powerful drugs provide highly 
          effective results. Often, a high dose is used initially to 
          bring the disorder under control. The drug is then tapered 
          to a low maintenance dose. This medicine is administered by
          pill or enema. Prednisone is a common generic name for it. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <u>Anti-inflammation Drugs</u> - sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), 
          Dipentum, Asacol, Rowasa, and Pentasa belong to a group of drugs 
          called the 5-aminosalicylate group. These drugs are most useful 
          in maintaining a remission, once the disease is brought under 
          control. They are available in oral and enema preparations. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <u>Immune Systems Suppressor</u> - These medications 
          suppress the body's immune system, which appears to be overly
          active and to perpetuate the disease. The names of two 
          of these commonly used mediations are azathioprine 
          (trade name: Imuran) and 6 MP (trade name: Purinethol). 
          There are other potent immune-suppressing drugs that may 
          be used in difficult cases. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <u>Antibiotics</u> - Since there is frequently a 
          bacterial infection along with Crohn's disease, a wide 
          assortment of antibiotics is available to treat this 
          problem. One that is commonly used is metronidazole 
          (trade name: Flagyl). 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">Diet and Emotions</h2>
      <p>
        There are no foods known to actually injure the bowel. However,
				during an acute phase of the disease, bulky foods, milk, 
				and milk products can increase diarrhea and cramping. 
				Generally, the patient is advised to eat a well-balanced 
				diet, with adequate protein and calories. The physician
				may recommend a multi-vitamin and iron supplement.
				<br/>
        <br/>
				Stress, anxiety, and extreme emotions may aggravate symptoms
				of the disorder, but are not believed to cause it or make 
				it worse. Any chronic disease can produce a serious emotional 
				reaction, which can usually be handled though discussion
				with the physician.
      </p>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">Surgery</h2>
      <p>
        Surgery is commonly needed at some time during the course 
				of Crohn's disease. It may involve removing a portion of 
				diseased bowel, or simply the draining of an abscess or 
				fistula. In all cases, the guiding principle is to perform
				the least amount of surgery to correct the problem. It 
				should be understood that surgery does not cure Crohn's disease.
      </p>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Most people with Crohn's disease lead active lives with few 
				restrictions. Although there is no known cure for the 
				disorder, it can be managed with present treatments. 
				For a few patients, the course of the disease can be 
				more difficult and complicated, requiring extensive 
				testing and therapy. Surgery sometimes is required. 
				In all cases, follow-up care is essential to treat 
				the disease and prevent complications that may arise.
