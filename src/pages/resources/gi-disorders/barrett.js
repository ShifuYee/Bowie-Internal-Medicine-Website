      <h1 className="main-subject">Barrett's Esophagus</h1>		
      <p>
        Heartburn is a burning sensation felt behind the breastbone and 
        sometimes in the neck and throat. It is caused by stomach acid 
        refluxing or splashing up into the esophagus (the muscular tube 
        that connects the throat to the stomach).
        <br />
        <br />
        At the lower end of the esophagus where it enters the stomach, 
        there is a strong muscular ring called the Lower Esophageal Sphincter 
        (LES). The LES should remain tightly closed, except to allow food and 
        liquid to pass into the stomach. Heartburn occurs when the LES opens 
        at the wrong time. Almost everyone has this occasionally, and it is 
        nothing to be concerned about. However, heartburn that is severe or 
        that occurs over a long period of time can be harmful. This is known 
        as Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD). If GERD is untreated, there 
        is constant acid irritation to the lining of the esophagus, and 
        complications can occur. About 1 in 10 patients with GERD are also 
        found to have a condition called Barrett's esophagus. It can be serious 
        and may lead to cancer of the esophagus.
      </p>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">What is Barrett's Esophagus ?</h2>
      <p>
        The cells lining the esophagus differ from those lining the stomach 
        or intestines, mainly because they have different functions. They also 
        have a distinctly different appearance, so it is easy for a physician to 
        tell them apart when examining the esophagus and stomach. Normally, 
        there is an area at the end of the esophagus that marks the border between 
        the cells of the esophagus and those of the stomach. Barrett'sesophagus is 
        the abnormal growth of stomach or intestinal-type cells above this border, 
        into the esophagus.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Barrett's tissue may spread evenly up into the esophagus, or it may be 
        present as islands or finger-like projections. Usually it is found in the 
        lower portion of the esophagus. However, it may extend throughout the 
        esophagus, or even be found by itself in the middle or upper esophagus.
        <br />
        <br />
        Since the cells lining the stomach are accustomed to contact with acids 
        their growth into the esophagus may actually be a defense mechanism. It 
        is designed to protect the normal tissue in the esophagus against further 
        damage by GERD. This may explain why the symptoms of GERD seem to lessen in 
        some patients with Barrett's esophagus. Unfortunately, these tissue changes 
        may be a forerunner of cancer of the lower esophagus, known as adenocarcinoma. 
        Cancer of the upper esophagus (squamous cell cancer) is usually related to 
        alcohol and smoking. This type of cancer appears to be decreasing in the 
        population, while the rate of adenocarcinoma is increasing sharply, especially 
        in white males.
        <br />
        <br />
        After many years, the Barrett's cells in some patients may develop abnormal 
        changes known as dysplasia. These changes may be in the size or appearance of 
        cells, or in the way the cells grow. Over a period of perhaps two to five years, 
        the dysplasia may progress from low grade, to moderate, to high grade and finally 
        to cancer. Fortunately, this happens only in about 5% of patients with Barrett's 
        esophagus.
      </p>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">Cause and Symptoms</h2>
      <p>
        For unknown reasons, Barrett's esophagus is found three times more often in males 
        than in females. In some instances, Barrett's esophagus appears to be congenital 
        (present at birth). However, current evidence is strong that in most instances it 
        develops as a result of chronic or long-standing GERD.
        <br />
        <br />
        In most cases, patients with Barrett's would have symptoms similar to those 
        produced by chronic GERD. Some Barrett's patients may also suffer from other 
        complications of GERD, such as peptic ulcers and stricture--narrowing of the 
        esophagus that comes from scarring. GERD patients with excess acid production 
        or frequent reflux of bile are more likely to develop Barrett's esophagus. This 
        is why it is important for patients with frequent or sever heartburn to see their 
        physicians regularly.
      </p>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">Diagnosis</h2>
      <p>
        Diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus requires an endoscopic examination. This is 
        done with the patient under sedation. The physician examines the lining of the 
        esophagus and stomach with a thin, lighted, flexible tube called an endoscope. 
        Biopsies are performed, taking pieces of the abnormal tissue to examine under a 
        microscope for dysplasia. If there is dysplasia, then follow-up exams must be 
        performed.
      </p>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">Treatment</h2>
      <p>
        Currently, there is no recognized treatment to reverse Barrett's 
				esophagus. However, it appears that treating the underlying GERD 
				may slow the progress of the disease and prevent complications. 
				Following are some things the patient can do to help reduce acid 
				reflux and strengthen the LES:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Avoid eating anything within three hours before bedtime.
				</li>
				<li>
					Avoid smoking and tobacco products. Nicotine in the blood weakens the LES.
				</li>
				<li>
					Avoid fatty foods, milk, chocolate, mints, caffeine, carbonated drinks, 
					citrus fruits and juices, tomato products, pepper seasoning,
					and alcohol (especially red wine).
				</li>
				<li>
					Eat smaller meals; avoid tight clothing or bending over after eating.
				</li>
				<li>
					Review all medications with the physician. Certain drugs can weaken the LES.
				</li>
				<li>
					Eat smaller meals; avoid tight clothing or bending over after eating.
				</li>
				<li>
					Elevate the head of the bed or mattress 6 to 8 inches.
					This helps to keep acid in the stomach by gravity.
					Pillows by themselves are not very helpful.
				</li>
				<li>
					Lose weight if overweight. This may relieve upward pressure on the stomach and LES.
				</li>
			</ul>	
        The physician may prescribe medications for acid reduction, such as Zantac,
        Pepcid, Axid, and Tagamet (generic: Cimetidine). Newer medications, such as
        Prilosec, Nexium, Protonix, and Prevacid, can almost eliminate stomach acid
        entirely and are almost always needed to treat severe GERD. 
        Reglan (generic: metoclopramide) is the drug that can strengthen the LES.
			<br/>
      <br/>
        Certain patients with GERD may need surgery to strengthen the LES. 
        This type of surgery is called fundoplication. It is often done by laparoscopy.
        Laparoscopy is minimally invasive surgery, performed with a tiny incision
        at the naval and a few needlepoints in the upper abdomen. The patient usually
        returns home in 1-2 days.
			<br/>
      <br/>
        A diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus requires regular monitoring by a physician.
        While it is thought that controlling GERD reduces the risk of developing cancer,
        this has not yet been definitely proven. Therefore, the physician must 
        perform regular endoscopy exams and biopsies to look for dysplasia. 
        Just how often these exams are repeated depends on how far the disease
        has advanced. If cancer is found, surgery to remove the lower esophagus
        (esophagectomy) is usually necessary. Physicians often recommend 
        this procedure when a high grade of dysplasia is present, so as to prevent
        the cancer that is likely to occur.
			<br/>
      <br/>
        There are also new experimental treatments being studied. They include
        laser destruction of the abnormal Barrett's tissue, and a process called
        photodynamic therapy. In this treatment, a special drug is injected 
        into the bloodstream and is absorbed only by the dysplastic cells.
        These cells are then destroyed when exposed to a special frequency 
        of red light. It is too soon to know how effective these treatments
        will be, but the early data is promising.
      </p>
      <h2 className="sub-topic">Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Barrett's esophagus is a condition that may develop as a result of chronic GERD. 
        Barrett's tissue growing in the esophagus is the body's defense against continued 
        stomach acid irritation. Yet, this tissue does not belong in the esophagus, and 
        for some patients, it increases the risk, of developing adenocarcinoma (cancer) 
        of the esophagus. While there is no treatment to reverse this condition, the 
        likelihood of developing cancer and complications can be reduced with a combination 
        of diet, lifestyle changes, medication, and/or surgery. A regular program of 
        endoscopic examination and biopsy is essential to monitor the Barrett's tissue. 
        There are also promising new techniques under investigation. By working closely 
        with a physician, patients with Barrett's esophagus can expect good control of 
        both GERD and Barrett's, and an excellent long-term outcome.
