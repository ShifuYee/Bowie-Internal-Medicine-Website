These compounds cause colon cancer in \r\n        laboratory animals. When residents in developing countries eat\r\n        a Westernized diet of meat, low roughage and refined grains, \r\n        over time they develop the same incidence of colon polyps as people \r\n        living in the Western world. So diet probably plays an important role \r\n        in causing colon cancer.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2 className=\"sub-topic\">Three Categories of Polyps</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Enough is now known about polyps that physicians generally place\r\n\t\t\t\tpatients in one of three categories. In each of these the end\r\n\t\t\t\tresult is an adenoma type polyp:\r\n      </p>\r\n      <ol>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <u>The Ordinary Polyp</u> - Most sporatic polyps occur between the \r\n          ages of 40 and 60. There may be only one or two present and \r\n          they may take ten years or more to develop into a cancer. \r\n          There is a hereditary link. \r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <u>Familial Polyposis</u> - This is a true hereditary condition in which the\r\n          entire colon is studded with hundreds, even thousands of polyps.\r\n          They begin at a very early age even under ten years old. \r\n          Virtually every patient will eventually develop colon cancer.\r\n          The only known preventive treatment is removal of the colon. \r\n          Fortunately, the condition is not common. \r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <u>Lynch Disorder</u> - This hereditary condition is more common than familial \r\n          polyposis and less than the ordinary polyp. There is a strong tendency\r\n          for adenoma type polyps to develop in blood relatives; sisters, \r\n          brothers, aunts, uncles and children. More polyps are seen and at\r\n          an early age. Polyps and even cancer can occur in the 30's and even \r\n          20's. In some families there is an increased incidence of breast, \r\n          ovarian, and other cancers. So a family history of this type warrants\r\n          very close surveillance of all direct blood relatives. \r\n        </li>\r\n      </ol>\r\n      <h2 className=\"sub-topic\">Detection</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The key to early detection of colon polyps and cancer is the concern \r\n        and willingness of each person to seek medical attention from a\r\n        physician. The physician will perform the following:\r\n      </p>\r\n      <ol>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <u>Medical history</u> - the patient's medical history will \r\n          identify the presence of risk factors for colon polyps and cancer. \r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <u>Stool exams to detect occult (hidden) blood</u> - colon cancers\r\n          and large polyps release minute quantities of blood; therefore, \r\n          examination of the stool for occult blood is an important exam. \r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <u>Sigmoidoscopy</u> - A visual exam of the rectum and lower colon, \r\n          using a lighted, rigid or flexible tube, or endoscope, \r\n          allows the direct detection of colon tumors. \r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <u>Colonoscopy</u> - This procedure examines the entire 5-6 foot long colon.\r\n          Physicians perform it when any of the above three detection methods\r\n          suggest a problem. The exam is usually done under sedation. \r\n          It is really the definitive test since colon polyps can be \r\n          discovered and removed at the same time. \r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <u>Barium Enema</u> - This x-ray exam is an older, at times still useful, exam.\r\n          Barium flows into the colon and x-rays are taken which then can\r\n          outline the shadows of polyps and cancer. Polyps cannot be \r\n          removed by this technique. \r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <u>Future tests</u> - It is possible that a blood genetic test may become \r\n          available to identify those individuals who are destined to\r\n          develop colon polyps and cancer.\r\n        </li>\r\n      </ol>\r\n      <h2 className=\"sub-topic\">How are Polyps removed ?</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Removal of colon polyps reduces the risk of subsequent development\r\n\t\t\t\tof cancer of the colon. Polyps are usually removed using a colonoscope,\r\n\t\t\t\twhich allows the physician to visualize the inside of the colon. Biopsy \r\n\t\t\t\tequipment and snares (wire loops) are passed through the endoscope and,\r\n\t\t\t\twith electrical heat (eletrocautery), remove polyps and small tumors. \r\n\t\t\t\tThis procedure is performed in the outpatient setting under sedation.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2 className=\"sub-topic\">Summary</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Cancer of the colon is a serious but readily detected malignancy. \r\n\t\t\t\tEarly detection promises a particularly high chance of survival. \r\n\t\t\t\tMost colon cancers start as polyps, which can usually be removed \r\n\t\t\t\tthrough a colonoscopic exam. Today, there is much that can be done \r\n\t\t\t\tto prevent and cure this cancer. The essential first step involves \r\n\t\t\t\taction by the patient.\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n)\r\n\r\nexport default ColonPolyps\r\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/pages/resources/gi-disorders/colonPolyps.js"],"sourceRoot":""}
