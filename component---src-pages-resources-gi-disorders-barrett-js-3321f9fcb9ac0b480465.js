The LES should remain tightly closed, except to allow food and liquid to pass into the stomach. Heartburn occurs when the LES opens at the wrong time. Almost everyone has this occasionally, and it is nothing to be concerned about. However, heartburn that is severe or that occurs over a long period of time can be harmful. This is known as Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD). If GERD is untreated, there is constant acid irritation to the lining of the esophagus, and complications can occur.
