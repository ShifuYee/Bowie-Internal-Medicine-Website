It is usually something minor that can be easily diagnosed, but not always. It is, therefore, important that the specific cause of rectal bleeding be identified so appropriate treatment can be started and the problem corrected.

It often will drain a whitish discharge, but it can also bleed. While it is usually just a local problem, a fistula can be associated with chronic inflammation in other parts of the intestinal tract. This disorder is called Crohn's disease. Fistulas are treated with antibiotics and hot baths. If they persist, surgery is usually required."),i.default.createElement("li",null,i.default.createElement("u",null,"Fissure")," - The passage of a hard stool or severe diarrhea may tear the lining tissue of the anus. This problem is similar to having cracked lips in cold weather. Nerve endings and blood vessels are exposed so that pain and bleeding occur with bowel movements.

Sometimes surgery is needed."),i.default.createElement("li",null,i.default.createElement("u",null,"Diverticulosis")," - Diverticulosis are pockets or sacs that project from the bowel wall. They balloon out over the years due to recurrent, high pressure spasm of the colon. Occasionally they can bleed. They bleed a lot and the blood comes all at one time.

There are a number of disorders which cause the inside surface of the bowel to become ulcerated and bleed. There may be rectal urgency, cramps or diarrhea associated with the bleeding. When the inflammation is restricted to the rectum, the condition is called proctitis. When the colon is involved, it is called colitis. It is important to identify the specific cause of the inflammation so that appropriate treatment can be started."),i.default.createElement("li",null,i.default.createElement("u",null,"Polyps and Cancer")," - Of course, the greatest concern about rectal bleeding is cancer. Polyps are benign growths in the colon. When polyp are a larger size, they can bleed. And certain types of polyps turn into cancer. Colon cancer is usually curable when discovered early. It most often occurs in people over the age of 50, but it is not unheard of in younger individuals, even in their 30's or y ounger.
