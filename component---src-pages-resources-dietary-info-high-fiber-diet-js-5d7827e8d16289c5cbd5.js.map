The increased bulk also reduces\r\n        the pressure necessary to push food waste through the colon. This results in less discomfort. \r\n        If irritable bowel syndrome is not treated it may lead to diverticulosis of the colon.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2 className=\"sub-topic\">High Fiber Diet and Colon Polyp/Cancer</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Colon cancer is a major health problem. It is second to lung cancer in the number\r\n        of deaths per year. In countries where grains are unprocessed and retain\r\n        their fiber, there is a lower incidence of colon cancer. Most colon cancer\r\n        begins as a colon polyp, a benign mushroom-shaped growth that in time grows\r\n        and, in some people, becomes a cancer. Colon cancer is preventable\r\n        if polyps are removed at an early stage. It is now known that the tendency\r\n        to develop colon cancer may be inherited, but there may be other factors\r\n        involved as well. One theory is that carcinogens in the diet and environment\r\n        can stay in contact with the colon wall a longer time and in higher\r\n        concentrations when the diet is low in fiber. A large, bulky stool acts\r\n        to dilute and diffuse these carcinogens and to move them through\r\n        the bowel more quickly. Less carcinogen exposure to the colon may\r\n        mean less colon polyps and lower the chance of developing cancer.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2 className=\"sub-topic\">High Fiber Diet and Diverticulosis</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Colon diverticulosis occurs when pockets or sacks bulge out from the bowel wall.\r\n        It is known that these diverticuli occur gradually over time and are due to\r\n        excessive pressure or spasms within the bowel. These pockets usually cause\r\n        no problem, unless infection occurs (diverticulitis) or if they break open,\r\n        causing abscess or peritonitis. A high-fiber diet may act to increase\r\n        the bulk in the stool, which reduces pressure within the colon. \r\n        By doing so, diverticuli formation may be reduced or even stopped.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2 className=\"sub-topic\">High Fiber Diet and Cholesterol</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        As noted above, fiber generally is divided into two categories. \r\n        Insoluble fiber is found in wheat bran and celluloses from vegetables\r\n        and fruits. Soluble fiber is commonly found in oatmeal, oat bran\r\n        (the ideal source), guar gum, psyllium seed, fruit pectin and gum arabic.\r\n        It also acts to lower blood cholesterol by binding with the cholesterol\r\n        in the intestine and carrying it away in the stool. So, a high fiber diet\r\n        should contain both types of fiber.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2 className=\"sub-topic\">High Fiber Foods</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        High fiber foods can be found in most food groups. \r\n        Different types of food should be selected to get the benefits of them all.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <ol>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<u>Legumes</u> - Including kidney, pinto, navy, lima, and baked beans.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe bean family excels in fiber. \r\n\t\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<u>Whole Grains</u> - Wheat bran and oat bran are present in a variety of cereals\r\n\t\t\t\t\tand breads. The label should say that the bread contains whole wheat\r\n\t\t\t\t\tor whole grain. Plain wheat bread may lack the fiber. \r\n\t\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<u>Whole Fresh Fruits</u> - The valuable pectin fiber is found in the skin and pulp. Figs, prunes, and raspberries have the highest fiber content.\r\n\t\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<u>Cooked or Stewed Fruit</u> - Prunes and applesauce are good choices. \r\n\t\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<u>Green Leafy Vegetables</u> - Lettuce, spinach, celery, and broccoli are good examples. \r\n\t\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<u>Root vegetables</u> - Potatoes, turnips, and carrots are all excellent sources. \r\n\t\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t</ol>\r\n      <p>\r\n\t\t\t\tSince bran can cause rumbling intestinal gas and even some mild cramping,\r\n\t\t\t\tit should be started in small amounts initially. The amount can be increased\r\n\t\t\t\tas tolerance is acquired. The goal should be 20 to 35 grams of fiber a day,\r\n\t\t\t\twhich will usually produce 1 to 2 soft, formed stools a day.\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n      <h3>The following are good general rules:</h3>\r\n\t\t\t<ol>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDrink plenty of liquids, including fruit or vegetable juices and water. \r\n\t\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tEat slowly and chew food thoroughly to allow the upper digestive tract\r\n\t\t\t\t\t(esophagus, stomach and small intestine) to work well. \r\n\t\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tEat meals at regular intervals.\r\n\t\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t</ol>\r\n      <h2 className=\"sub-topic\">A Dietary Fiber Supplement May Be Helpful</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Some people have trouble tolerating too much high fiber foods in the diet.\r\n        Stool softening and bulking agents are available over the counter. \r\n        These products are usually plant fiber that absorbs water and produce \r\n        the bulk necessary for the digestive tract to perform naturally.\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        Psyllium fiber is found in many commercial products such as Metamucil,\r\n        Per Diem and Konsyl. The regular product contains a fair amount of sugar,\r\n        so it may be preferable to use the sugar free products. Most pharmacies carry\r\n        a generic brand at a significant savings. \r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        Citrucel (hemicellulose) and Equilactin (polycarboxisal) are other bulking agents \r\n        that can be used. These fiber supplements, in conjunction with foods, \r\n        offer an easy way to reach the fiber goal of 20 to 35 grams per day.\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n)\r\n\r\nexport default HighFiberDiet\r\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/pages/resources/dietary-info/highFiberDiet.js"],"sourceRoot":""}
